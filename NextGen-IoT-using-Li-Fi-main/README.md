# Li-Fi Based Short-Range Data Transmission System

Welcome to the Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) project — a next-gen wireless communication system that uses visible light instead of traditional radio waves to securely and efficiently transmit data. This project demonstrates a cost-effective, interference-free, and real-time data transmission solution using common components like a smartphone flashlight, an LDR sensor, Arduino Uno, and an LCD display.


# 🚀 Project Highlights


📲 Light-Based Data Transfer: Sends text messages using your smartphone’s flashlight.

👁️‍🗨️ LDR Receiver: Detects light pulses using a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR).

🔧 Arduino-Powered Processing: Decodes the light signals and displays the message.

📺 Real-Time Output: Message appears on a 16x2 LCD screen instantly.

🔐 Highly Secure: Visible light can’t pass through walls, ensuring secure transmission.

🛡️ EMI-Free: Ideal for use in sensitive environments like hospitals, airplanes, and underwater.



# 🧠 How It Works


Encoding: A text message is converted into binary and transmitted as light pulses using a smartphone flashlight.

Receiving: The LDR detects variations in light intensity corresponding to binary data.

Processing: An Arduino Uno reads the LDR input, decodes the binary, and converts it back into readable text.

Display: The decoded message is shown on a 16x2 LCD display.
